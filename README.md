# Overview

The `disturbanceGenerator_NT` is a parent module for three children modules that are stand alone: `anthroDisturbance_DataPrep`, `potentialResourcesNT_DataPrep` and `anthroDisturbance_Generator`, the second being idiosyncratic to Northwest Territories data. 
The other two modules are, however, generic and can be applied in other contexts, potentially without modifications. 

These modules aim at simulating anthropogenic disturbance generation (i.e., mining, oil and gas, forestry, etc.) and were 
primarily developed for improving caribou range planning in Northern Canada. Each module is detailed below. In this report, 
we provide an example of usage of the three modules together. Each individual module, however, can be used used stand alone and 
references on how to use them can be found in their individual documentation.

Please see the PDF document where the module is explained in details: <https://github.com/tati-micheletti/disturbanceGenerator_NT/blob/main/disturbanceGenerator_NT.pdf>
